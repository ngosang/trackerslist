Are you having DNS problems? These lists contains the same trackers but with IP addresses instead of domains:
* trackers_best_ip (20 trackers) => https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ngosang/trackerslist/master/trackers_best_ip.txt
* trackers_all_ip (83 trackers) => https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ngosang/trackerslist/master/trackers_all_ip.txt

##### Notes
* A bot automatically checks the trackers and updates the lists.
* Trackers with the same domain or pointing to the same IP address are removed. Check out the [blacklist](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ngosang/trackerslist/master/blacklist.txt).
* Trackers are sorted by popularity and latency (from best to worst).
* WebSocket trackers (AKA WebTorrent, ws, wss) are supported by few clients. [More info](https://webtorrent.io).
