Updated list of public BitTorrent trackers

#### Updated: 2020-01-03
*These lists are automatically updated every day:*

* trackers_best (20 trackers) => https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ngosang/trackerslist/master/trackers_best.txt
* trackers_all (90 trackers) => https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ngosang/trackerslist/master/trackers_all.txt
* trackers_all_udp (54 trackers) => https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ngosang/trackerslist/master/trackers_all_udp.txt
* trackers_all_http (30 trackers) => https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ngosang/trackerslist/master/trackers_all_http.txt
* trackers_all_https (6 trackers) => https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ngosang/trackerslist/master/trackers_all_https.txt
* trackers_all_ws (4 trackers) => https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ngosang/trackerslist/master/trackers_all_ws.txt

Are you having DNS problems? These lists contains the same trackers but with IP addresses instead of domains:
* trackers_best_ip (20 trackers) => https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ngosang/trackerslist/master/trackers_best_ip.txt
* trackers_all_ip (82 trackers) => https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ngosang/trackerslist/master/trackers_all_ip.txt

##### Notes
* A bot automatically checks the trackers and updates the lists.
* Trackers with the same domain or pointing to the same IP address are removed. Check out the [blacklist](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ngosang/trackerslist/master/blacklist.txt).
* Trackers are sorted by popularity and latency (from best to worst).
* WebSocket trackers (AKA WebTorrent, ws, wss) are supported by few clients. [More info](https://webtorrent.io).
* Lists with IP addresses can be shorter because [Cloudflare IPs](https://www.cloudflare.com/ips/) are removed.
